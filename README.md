# KeepUp

Thank you for your interest in KeepUp!
The best way to get in quick with your Upwork applications.

KeepUp continuously monitors Upwork for new jobs within your search criteria and let you know about them as soon as they become available.

## Operating Systems

This app has been tested stable on Windows 7 and Windows 10. This app is not *currently* available for operating systems other than Windows, but there are plans to change this!

## How to install

1. Just download the latest release on our release page, [here.](https://github.com/KeepUp-app/KeepUp/releases/latest)
  You will want to download the .exe file, which should have a name similar to: 'keepup-Setup-1.0.0.exe', where the '1.0.0' is replaced with the latest stable version number.
2. Once the file has downloaded, run it to install the app. The app will usually be installed to `C:\Users\[YOUR_USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Programs\keepup`

## How to register

1. Before you can use the KeepUp app, you will need to create a subscription with KeepUp. The link to do so is here:
[https://buy.paddle.com/product/581180](https://buy.paddle.com/product/581180 "KeepUp's checkout through Paddle").
This will show up on your bill as "Paddle".
2. You will then receive an email confirmation from Paddle, and from KeepUp. The email from KeepUp will include your username (based off the email address that you use) and a **temporary password**.
3. In your app, login using your username and temporary password - you will then be asked to choose a permanent password.

## How to use

1. Simply log into the app using your username and password (see 'How to Register', above).
2. This will bring you to the main screen, where you can select your job options. These options are the same as the options for searching on Upwork itself, with the exception that there is currently no ability to use keywords. This may be added at a future date.
3. You can select multiple **categories** or subcategories to include - selecting a category is the same as selecting *all* subcategories.
4. You can **pause** the search at any time by selecting the pause checkbox at the top of the screen, this will stop KeepUp from checking for updates while it is paused.
5. You can **mute** the search at any time by selecting the mute checkbox at the top of the screen, this will stop KeepUp from playing sound when jobs are returned.
8. Your preferences as selected here will be saved for next time.
6. To **Log out**, click on the dropdown list at the top right of the screen, and click 'Log out'.
7. To raise a **Support ticket**, including for any account related inquiries or to cancel your subscription, click on the dropdown list at the top right of the screen and click 'Support'. A link to support is also found at the bottom of the screen.

## Updates

KeepUp will automatically scan for new versions on startup. If there are any new versions of KeepUp available, KeepUp will download and install them automatically. The new version will run the next time that you start KeepUp. You won't have to reset your preferences.
